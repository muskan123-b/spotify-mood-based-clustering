# spotify-mood-based-clustering

Everyone loves listening to music. It is far more than just a pleasant sound to the ear. The scientific reason why people love music so much is because it causes dopamine to be released from the brain. Talking about myself, just like everyone, Itoo like to listen music. No matter what mood I am in, there is a song that goes with it. Whether i feel upset or want to brighten my day up, music has always been there for me.

Spotify is one such platform on which you can listen to music and play millions of songs and podcasts for free. I have been using Spotify since 2-3 years now and haven't used any other platform since then. Being an avid Spotify user, one feature which I feel is lacking is Mood based Spotify playlist, where in I can just listen to songs by simply clicking on playlist related to whatever mood I am in. Thus, I tried clustering the songs according to various moods using my spotify listening data.
